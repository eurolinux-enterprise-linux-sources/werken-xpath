werken.xpath :: Werken JDOM XPath Engine :: README.txt
------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ----------------------------------------
        INTRODUCTION
  ----------------------------------------

This is the Werken JDOM XPath Engine (werken.xpath), created by  the 
Werken & Sons Company. It's available at <http://code.werken.com/xpath>.

It's not overly useful by itself, but rather needs an (currently in
development) implementation of XPointer, XSLT, or other XPath-based 
specification.  werken.xpath is merely an engine which can parse XPaths,
and walk JDOM <http://www.jdom.org/> trees.


  ----------------------------------------
        REQUIREMENTS
  ----------------------------------------

* A modern Java2 platform :: 

  I'm using Sun's official JSDK 1.3 for Linux.  Others should work
  without much trouble also.

    <http://java.sun.com/>
    <http://www.blackdown.org/>
    <http://www.ibm.com/>


* The JDOM package. 

  This was written against the CVS tree, so it might not work with
  whatever milestone source drop you're using.  Hopefully a stable 
  release of JDOM will appear, and we can nail down a specific minimum
  version. 

    <http://www.jdom.org/>


* ANTLR Parser-Generator 2.7.x

  Once again, I'm using a pre-release candidate, which has special
  new features to play friendly with jakarta-ant (which is included).

  The version of ANTLR we're using is (and always will be) included
  in the distribution of werken.xpath.  If you wish, you may always obtain
  your own copy, with full documentation.  *Everything* is simply a
  parsing problem, after all.

  ----------------------------------------
        DOCUMENTATION
  ----------------------------------------

Generated javadoc documentation will appear in the build/apidocs/
directory.

box.  Just some place, give credit where credit is due.

        ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
  ----------------------------------------

  * bob mcwhirter (bob@werken.com) -- Implementor of the initial code
    base of werken.xpath.

  * Michael Hinchy -- Originally started the JDOM XPath project, but
    I forked, with 100% original code.  Still, he motivated the work.

  * Terence Parr (parrt@jguru.com) -- Let me hack on ANTLR for my own
    evil purposes.  Also, he originally wrote ANTLR, and we'd like to
    give him credit for the wonderful tool he's graciouslly given to
    the community.

  * Jason Hunter (jhunter@collab.net) -- One of the JDOM guys (sorry,
    but I've never dealt with Brett).  Lively banter back'n'forth 
    regarding JDOM, XPath, ant && antlr.

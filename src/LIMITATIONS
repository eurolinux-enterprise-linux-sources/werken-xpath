Things that DO NOT WORK, and we already know about them:

1) Anything that is a peer of the root node of the document (comments, PIs).

2) Some functions:
	position()
	id(object)
	normalize-space(string?)
	translate(string,string,string)
	lang(string)

3) Positional predicates

All else *should* be working (all axes, filter-exprs, predicates, etc)
